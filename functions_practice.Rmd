```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
df <- tibble::tibble(
  a = rnorm(10),
  b = rnorm(10),
  c = rnorm(10),
  d = rnorm(10)
)
```

```{r}
x <- df$a
rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE)
(x - rng[1])/(rng[2] - rng[1])
```
```{r}
rescale01 <- function(x) {
  rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  (x - rng[1])/(rng[2] - rng[1])
}

rescale01(c(0,3,9))
```

```{r}
d <- df$b 
rescale01(d)
```

```{r}
df$a <- rescale01(df$a)
df$b <- rescale01(df$b)
df$c <- rescale01(df$c)
df$d <- rescale01(df$d)
```

```{r}
x <- c(1:10, Inf); x
rescale01(x)
```

Because weâ€™ve extracted the code into a function, we only need to make the fix in one place:

```{r}
rescale01 <- function(x) {
  rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE, finite = TRUE)
  (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
}
rescale01(x)
```
