## For next meeting:
- Step 1: Order of differencing
  + TS plot of residuals from ARIMA(0,0,0) w/ constant in not exactly stationary -> d = 1
  
- Step 2: AR() or MA()
1. Obtain residual from current model: ARIMA(0,1,0) w/ constant
2. Plot PACF of the residual

- Step 3: Seasonality()
1. Look at the PACF to determine AR() or MA() terms
