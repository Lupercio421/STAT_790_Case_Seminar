# STAT_790_Case_Seminar
Hey everyone, this semester I am enrolled in the Project Seminar course for the B.A./M.A. program. Using data from the NYC Department of Sanitation, I am analyzing waste tonnage collected throughout the five boroughs.

## Goals for this project:
* The challenge I am taking on is to create a univariate time series model to anaylze the total waste collected within the Bronx
  + I am beginning with the Bronx, as I plan to create a model with data from all five borouhgs
* After I am comfortable with a preliminary forecast of this univariate time series, I plan to create a dynamic regression time series
  + Here I plan to incorporate other predictors
* With time permitting, I plan to incoprate Machine Learning models on either the univariate or multivariate time series

## Predictors that I am considering
* American Community Survey data for NYC
* US Census Bureau data for NYC
* NYC DOE School Enrollment data
* The Economic Index

## Resources that are helping me complete this project
* Forecasting and Principles, third edition 
* Advanced R
* R for Data Science
* Numerous research papers taking on a similar task within other countries
