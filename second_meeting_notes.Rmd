## Things to consider:
* Perhaps look at each waste stream as an individual time series, so three time series
* Or perhaps aggregate all three waste streams, per community district, per borough


## Goal for next meeting:
* Explore economic index per month for the previous two decades
* Explore Census data for NYC population by the year
* Explore Dynamic Regression Model
  + With the goal of regressing the aggregated time series data onto the economic index and population count
* Get familiar with ARIMAX modeling
* Begin plotting and prelim analysis [aggregate the waste streams]
* Continue to reference Forecasting: Principle and Practice textbook [https://otexts.com/fpp3/]
* Continue to reference modeltime package
