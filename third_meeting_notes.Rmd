## Things to consider:
* US Census Bureau or ACS data is good, but for now, focus on getting NYC data as general population
  + If we need to go through the community districts, then brush up on the ACS queries
  + NYC Population FactFinder [https://popfactfinder.planning.nyc.gov/#11.59/40.7239/-73.8894]


## Goal for next meeting:
* Look for seasonality with a further plot for each borough
  + look for trends
  + reference ffps [https://otexts.com/fpp3/seasonal-plots.html]
* Begin a preliminary forecast
  + Create a subset of the DSNY_thrid dataframe, to include the Bronx
  + Make sure your dataframe is turned into a tibble
  + Create a model with auto.arima()
  + Compare the metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)
  + This is done with auto.arima()
* Summarize your results
* Then, if time permits, explore an ARIMAX model
  + For example, regress the Bronx refuse onto economic index, total population, etc...
  + Explore adjustments: [https://otexts.com/fpp3/transformations.html]
  + Explore models with adjustments and without adjustments, both for population and economic data
+ Grab the data-set for 2021
  + To compare the forecast values with the actual collected tonnage
* Send the professor your summary (copy+past results) by next Fri morning
